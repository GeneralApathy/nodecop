# nodecop
A free, open source, Node.js based Supreme Bot (super early version, don't use it)

## The development of the bot is paused because I'm working on the server-side (and I also had some school-related stuff to do), but it will be certainly available for the next season.

# When I say "don't use it", I mean it
You shouldn't use this program, because frequent updates are made and probably some versions will be broken, so just wait until the final release. 
This repository will remain active and updated even after the official release, so you don't need to worry about it.

#  Known bugs
- None for now
