# nodecop
A free, open source, Node.js based Supreme Bot (super early version, don't use it)

# When I say "don't use it", I mean it
You shouldn't use this program, because frequent updates are made and probably some versions will be broken, so just wait until the final release. 
This repository will remain active and updated even after the official release, so you don't need to worry about it.

#  Known bugs
- Captcha not rendering on Linux (what idk why)

# Credits
Huge thanks to:
- dzt: https://github.com/dzt/captcha-harvester for making this super-useful thing
- Tony Nicotra: for explaining some important stuff
